# CTF for beginners

This is a repository dedicated to people beginning to learn cyber forensics.
I have split the learning process into many parts based on how they appear in CTF's.

- Crypto
- Disk Forensics
- File Forensics
- Steganography
- Reversing
- Networking

NOTE: REMEMBER THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO LEARN IS NOT SOME CONCEPT
BUT HOW TO LEARN IT ie. INFORMATION GATHERING. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL
EVER!!!!
Good luck!

#### SOME TIPS
>- Use the man pages for commands that you dont know how to use eg: man grep
>- Use this to access you typing history in a convinient method. 
```sh
gedit ~/.inputrc
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward
"\e[C": forward-char
"\e[D": backward-char
```
>- You can get a editor for windows but for linux you can use the default one on terminal using: 'hexeditor <file_name>'
>- To view hex and ASCII you can use: 'hexdump -C' or open the file on DFF. 
>- You should learn to use grep to find certain text from huge clumps of text. I did it from the man pages for grep: 'man grep'
